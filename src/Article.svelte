                <strong>Magnetic lashes have forever changed my life</strong>
                and after using them
                <strong>I am sure they will forever change yours too.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s face it,
                <strong>girls with long lashes get the smiles and attention.</strong>
                My friend who pays $150 plus tip every 4 weeks and has the best
                eyelashes ever is
                <strong>always getting attention and compliments on her eye’s</strong>.
                Most people do not even realize why, they are just drawn to
                them.
            </p>
            <div class="image-hero-box">
                <img
                    src="https://ik.imagekit.io/usam13ogl7u/eyelash-sdfsdf_prv5PlUyYz.jpg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>I wanted that attention too but unlike her, I am not
                    willing to go deep into debt</strong>
                paying $150+ a month on eyelashes, so I gave up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then
                <strong>like always my phone came to my rescue and Facebook
                    showed me an ad for these magnetic lashes that you can do at
                    home.</strong>
                I was an easy sell, magnetic lashes that can be worn 20-30 times
                and put on at home for under $20?
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://freelashkit.com"><strong>Sign me up!</strong></a>
            </p>
            <p>So I did and a few days later they came.</p>

            <p>
                Oh how glorious. Then it settled in,
                <strong>what did I get myself in to … they said it was easy but
                    would it be?</strong>

                I waited 5 minutes until it was all dry then looked in the
                mirror.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did it,
                <strong>It was really one of the easiest thing’s I’ve ever done</strong>
                and now instead of just my friend having beautiful lashes I have
                them too.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img

                <strong>I went out, got lots of smiles … at first, I thought OMG
                    did they fall off?</strong>
                Am I sitting here with a caterpillar hanging from my eye?
                <strong>But each time I checked they were on perfectly, the
                    whole night.</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="img-box" style="float:left; margin-right:1rem;">

            </div>
            <p>
                The best part is
                <strong>it didn’t cost me $150+</strong>
                like my friend, I found
                <strong>this company called Slick</strong>
                that gives them away, you just need to pay the shipping cost as
                a way to introduce you to their brand and magnetic lashes, they
                have dozens of cool lash styles so I am going to go back and try
                some of the more exotic ones but they had a lot of natural ones
                too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, magnetic lashes proved to be exactly what I needed
                to solve my lash envy, they were easy to put on, they arrived
                fast and they fit my budget. A total success.

            <p>
                One of the things that really sold me on Slick was this video of
                someone blow drying the lash off their eye, since it never moved
                or came off it sold me on the hold and that I wouldn’t look like
                a fool with my lash hanging off. Since wearing them I can
                confirm this was well, these really stay on, no matter what but
                they clean up easily with jut water and a qtip.
